%NEOCLASSICAL_MODEL_RUN.M
%This program computes a second-order  approximation to the policy functions of a simple neoclassical model (see ``Solving Dynamic General Equilibrium Models Using a Second-Order Approximation to the Policy Function,'' by Stephanie Schmitt-Grohe and Martin Uribe, (JEDC, 2004, p. 755-775). The equilibrium conditions of the model can be written as: %E_t[f(yp,y,xp,x)=0, 
%The solution is of the form
%xp = h(x,sigma) + sigma* eta * ep
%y = g(x,sigma)
%The quadratic approximation to these functions are (in tensor notation) [Notation: x is x_t and xp is x_t+1, variables are expressed in log-deviations from their steady state value]
%xp^i = hx^i_a x_a + 1/2 [hxx^i_ab x_a x_b + hss^i sigma^2] + sigma*  eta^i_c ep_c
%y^i = gx^i_a x_a + 1/2 [gxx^i_ab x_a x_b + gss^i sigma^2]
%
%where 
% hx is nx by nx
% gx is ny by nx
% hxx is nx by nx by nx
% gxx is ny by nx by nx
% eta is nx by ne
% gss is ny by 1
% hss is nx by 1
% sigma is a positive scalar
